# SCRIPTS

A set of handy scripts for you to manipulate your big data, e.g., transcriptomics, genomics, and etc. 

To learn more about each script, please read the initial line in the script. It provides you with the example of how to run the script.

If you do use them in your research, I would be grateful if you can cite this github repository.
